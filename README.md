# 🌸 Personal Portfolio – Coded with Cats & Creativity 🐾

Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and Full-Stack Development. This is my personal webpage — a creative space where I showcase my skills, projects, and personality, all wrapped in a pastel-purrfect theme! 🐱💻

## ✨ What's Inside?

- 🎨 A cute & colorful design to reflect my love for aesthetic interfaces
- 🧠 A brief about me and my interests in tech
- 🧰 Skills displayed with emoji-powered badges
- 🐾 Animated cat elements and playful styling
- 💼 Plans to add projects, blog posts, and more!

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – Structure and content
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, and those adorable pastel bubbles
- **JavaScript** *(coming soon)* – Interactive features and animations

## 🐱 Why the cats?

Why not? I believe learning and building things should be fun! Plus, I'm combining tech skills with visual storytelling. And if a dancing cat can make you smile — mission accomplished. 💖
